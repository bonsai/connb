# UX

## Principles

- Fast feedback with compact output
- Minimal required options
- Errors are short and actionable

## CLI Output

- One event uses two lines
- First line is the title
- Second line shows URL, start time, and capacity

## Failure Behavior

- Input errors exit with code 2
- Runtime errors exit with code 1
